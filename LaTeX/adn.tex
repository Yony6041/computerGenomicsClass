\section{Rembering old topics on DNA}

\paragraph{What is DNA made of?}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Pentose sugar (the \emph{sides} of the ladder)
    \item Phosphate group (the \emph{sides} of the ladder)
    \item Nitrogenous bases (the rungs of the ladder)
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{What is a polymer: \\}
Any of a class of natural or synthetic substances composed of very large molecules, called macromolecules.

\paragraph{What is a Nitrogenous base made of?}

\paragraph{What process can you do with DNA?}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Translation (Protein Synthesis)
    \item Transcription (Synthesizes RNA)
    \item Central Dogma (Transcription + Translation)
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Where on earth can I find DNA? \\}
The nucleus of a cell contains Chromosomes \\ 
and DNA is contained within the Chromosomes.
